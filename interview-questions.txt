Scenario Questions

A time you succeeded / Your biggest accomplishments / Your greatest challenge

A time I succeeded was when I successfully created a fully-functioning marketing page for a client, 
my biggest accomplishment was recording and releasing two full-length albums all by myself, 
and those two things were actually my greatest challenges as well.

A time you persuaded someone who did not agree with you

At Jamba Juice we had a very long line and it was very busy.
I persuaded a few team members to switch their tasks around to better ensure 
customer satisfaction and deliver their drinks more fast and efficiently.

A time you dealt with and resolved a conflict (among team members)

During a build-week, we had a particular individual who truly was not a "Team Player" 
and was being very unprofessional / rude to a fellow asset to our team. 
We brought this to the attention of our Team leads and Section leads to handle and tackle accordingly, therefore, resolving the conflict.

A time you led a team / a time you showed leadership skills

One time working at Starbucks, there was two brand-new team members that were still not trained. 
I was the only experienced worker working at the time, so I took them under my wing and 
juggled all the tasks for the day while teaching them and ensuring customer satisfaction was constantly met.

A time you dealt with stress / The most difficult problem you've encountered in your previous job, and how you solved it

One time working at Starbucks, I opened the store alone at 7 AM, 
was told no-one else would be coming into their shift, and proceeded to close the store at 3 PM. 
Essentially I did the opening tasks (2 ppl required), mid-shift tasks (2 ppl required), and closing tasks (2 ppl required) all alone.

A time you solved a problem creatively

One time while I was building a website for a client, I was asked to implement a feature 
I didn't have lots of experience with. I did some research and figured out my own way of adding 
it to avoid copying code. It was a fun challenge.

A time you had to exceed expectations to get a job done

Myself along with my team went the extra mile to generate 1000 rooms for our tower maze game instead of sticking with 500.

A time you showed initiative

When I worked on the labs project with a few peers, I attended meetings with our stakeholder every wednesday to ensure his satisfaction of the product we were building.

Tell me something thatâ€™s not on your resume

I play Piano, Guitar, Bass, and Drums

An example of an important goal you set and how you reached it

I planned to release an album by the end of the year in January 2019. 
I played music give or take everyday to ensure my album would be released by the end of the year and I managed to make it happen.

A time you failed

During a build week project mentioned prior, due to all the inner conflicts surrounding 
the one member of our team, we ended up being unsuccessful in delivering a fully function product.
